Hello, this is my Geography Trivia Game!
It runs locally on your computer and is my way of geting practice / more familiar with standard techniques to write front-end code. A little about my code below. Enjoy.

About my code:
I had two origional intentions for my code: 1. be able to use both questions from the API and the CSV live and 2. for all of the questions through the API to be relevant to a country. I thought these good ideas so that users could choose to upload/edit local questions that they might want to play with or "train" on and also so that the code could be extended in the future to more closely mirror something like the Stack the Countries game (a game I was a huge fan of myself as a kid, although I must admit I was more of a Stack the States guy). Both of these, I was (after much iteration) pretty much able to successfully implement alongside other general features like a score board, all questions being multiple choice (including the CSV ones which populate alternative answer choices from the list of countries used to check API questions), and a reset button. Something else that was very challenging to work with that I had to work around was running into rate limits with the API. To solve this, I implemented a cache for API questions, and even attempted to implement a system where the program would automatically switch over to the CSV questions as a sort of buffer before returning back to the API questions. This system I believe mostly works. I also implemented a decent about of the architure for hints to be available but fell short on timing to get the full implementation.
