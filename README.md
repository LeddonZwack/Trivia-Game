About my code:
My original intention for my code was for it to combine / have the flexibility for the user to able to choose whether to use questions from the API or use the default questions in the CSV. This manifested only partially with various iterations of my code performing better at this task than later versions as complexity increased. Additionally, I origionally had a function (still there just not used now) included that would screen any API code to ensure that it had a county's name in it. This way, if the game were to evolve in the future to have more similarity to Stack the Countries, only questions to which we could associate a country to easily would be used. I ended up removing this from the functionality later to try to simply while debugging, but I think it was still a good idea. Another issue I ran into in this project was making too many calls to the Open Trivia Database, so I created a cache and attempted to use the CSV questions as a buffer. This proved to be difficult, but I was able to get it mostly working though, aside from a small kink where when the game first loads the program immeadiately switches to CSV mode since the API function call failed.

Reflection:
All in all, I think my program is decent, and I did enjoy learning through the process of implementing this game. I was unfamiliar with javascript and the full stack libraries before this and by doing this project I feel that I did gain helpful experince working with them. If I had more time with this project, I'd fix the minor error I mentioned, glamorize the UX, and add in the hints functionality (which although is almost entirely set up, is not fully implemented right now). Thanks for the oppertunity to complete this project!
